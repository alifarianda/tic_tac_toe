# FWD Test
## Tic Tac Toe

This is my test projects for FWD Singapore which is a game called **Tic Tac Toe** based on **Java Spring (Backend)** and **HTML-CSS-JQuery (Frontend)**.

How to run :
- Make sure you have installed JDK/JRE 8.
- Run (Recommended) : Open cmd, execute this command **"java -jar /path/to/tic_tac_toe.jar"**.
- Run (Quick, Not Recommended) : Click 2x **tic_tac_toe.jar** file.
- The app will be run on your computer portable, no need to deploy on server because it uses Spring Boot which already embed Tomcat.
- Open web browser (recommended : Google Chrome), go to : http://localhost:8001/fwd/home.
- The page will be loaded, make sure you have internet connection, because CSS and JQuery libs that I used is CDN based.
- Enjoy the game.
